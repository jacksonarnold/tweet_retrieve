# tweet_retrieve
- NCHB2-txtab.txt is a list of Tweet ID's for Tweets related to North Carolina's House Bill 2. I downloaded the file by the name "NCHB2-txt.ab" from the following repo: https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/HB2-Twitter-data

- tweets.csv is a CSV of the first 5 Tweets retrieved using the Tweet ID's in NCHB2-txtab.txt. I only retrieved the full text from the tweets, but can grab more attributes.

- To run rehydrate.py make sure you replace the consumer_key, consumer_secret, acces_token, and access_token_secret with your own credentials.

*search.jsonl is just a file that I used to see how the Tweets were formatted as JSON objects.
